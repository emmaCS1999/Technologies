Smart Mat 
This is the smart mat it uses a MicroBit sensor to detect light and send the information to the raspberry pi to alert it when someone is stood in the shower. This is a siple prrof of concept which can be ntegrated into a larger project surrounding the use of dtaa to aid remote care of older people. 
A Microbit and Rapsberry Pi where ustilised withhin this project and jaavscript and node.sj was used to process the sensr data. Html and CSS were utilised to make the webpage element. 
This code is a very simple initial stage in the future developmet of the mat. This can be utilised for people who also want to integrate sesor data through beacons to develop light sensor technology based on light percentage.



The other prototypes: Heart rate monitor and Smart pill box
These all meet the same criteria of a aiding remote care of older people though IoT devises. These are easily implemented prototype that present a proof of concept for the future development of a system thta can inteegrate all of the ideas
